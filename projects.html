                    This project aimed to enhance human-computer interaction by replacing traditional methods of visual
                    data analysis (keyboard and mouse) with psychologically intuitive hand-gesture controls. For this
                    project, I trained a convolutional neural network on a 27-class dataset to recognise dynamic hand
                    gestures, and introduced a mapping methodology for a novel Unity environment.<br><br>This project

                    A novel design of an emergency vehicle combining classical mechanics with electronics engineering. A
                    hydraulic master-slave cylinder system was built, actuated with a stepper/lead screw and a makeshift
                    connecting rod. The robot was fitted with multiple HC-SR04 distance sensors to calculate
                    velocity, acceleration and 'jerk' (rate of change of acceleration) such that a contact surface was

                    This TSP solution was developed using an initial greedy algorithm to provide the first 'optimal'
                    path, after which subsequent searches either replaced this optimal path or were pruned before
                    completion. This algorithm found an optimal solution in 23 seconds, on a 28-city dataset with a
                    maximum distance of
                    246 units between them.<br><br>This project was done as part of my 3rd-year undergraduate module

                    This website was developed from scratch over a period of 9 days.<br><br> I used Jira as a project
                    management tool, and github as version control. It is written in pure HTML/CSS and JS, structured
                    with CSS Grids and Flexboxes, without Bootsrap, GSAP or any finishing libraries. It was designed in
                    2 days, broken into fundamental steps using Jira on the 3rd day, and code-writing took a further 6
                    days.<br><br>Future updates to this website will include these extraneous libraries in order to
                    bring it up to commercial quality. However, this first iteration is quite close to what I imagined
                    under such a short timeframe.
