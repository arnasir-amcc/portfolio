                    My journey into computation is powered by dreams of simulating the biological underpinnings of the
                    greatest computational device in history: the human brain. Wiring a sensor to an actuator is simple
                    enough to perform in robotics, so why not investigate a similar relationship to the sensor in our
                    skulls?
                    <br><br> I have a certain and deep interest in both neuroscience and computation, and my desire
                    to
                    interweave these interests is reflected in my choice of study. On a broader overview, I set my
                    aspirations in neuroprosthetics, being lost in a world of transhumans and exoskeletons as a child.
                    That
                    methodology of continuously seeking to improve, or augment myself such that I am able to access more
                    of the 'big picture' continues today.

                <div class="general-text" id="about-page-full-width-text">Bridging the gap between biology and machines
                    requires
                    an intimate understanding of the half that humanity hasn't directly created. The pursuit of a
                    sufficiently powerful, low-energy, low-cost AI algorithm was perfected thousands of years ago by the
                    human brain. Our primary objective today is to encapsulate the entirety of that structure within a
                    simulation, with an objective to improve it towards ever-more powerful AI, or eventually machine
                    sentience. To that end, I seek to initiate alongside thousands of peers worldwide, the initial
                    process of comparison between neural computation and our closest guess at it: neural networks.
