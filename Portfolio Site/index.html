                    My journey into computation is powered by dreams of simulating the biological underpinnings of the greatest computational device in history: the human brain. Wiring a sensor to an actuator is simple enough to perform in robotics, so why not investigate a similar relationship to the sensor in our skulls?
                    <br><br> I have a certain and deep interest in both neuroscience and computation, and my desire
                    to
                    interweave these interests is reflected in my choice of study. On a broader overview, I set my
                    aspirations in neuroprosthetics, being lost in a world of transhumans and exoskeletons as a child.
                    That
                    methodology of continuously seeking to improve, or augment myself such that I am able to access more of the 'big picture' continues today.

                <div class="general-text" id="about-page-text-2">Bridging the gap between biology and machines requires an intimate understanding of the half that humanity hasn't directly created. The pursuit of a sufficiently powerful, low-energy, low-cost AI algorithm was perfected thousands of years ago by the human brain. Our primary objective today is to encapsulate the entirety of that structure within a simulation, with an objective to improve it towards ever-more powerful AI, or eventually machine sentience. To that end, I seek to initiate alongside thousands of peers worldwide, the initial process of comparison between neural computation and our closest guess at it: neural networks.</div>
