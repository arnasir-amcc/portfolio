                    This project aimed to enhance human-computer interaction by replacing traditional methods of visual
                    data analysis (keyboard and mouse) with psychologically intuitive hand-gesture controls. For this
                    project, I trained a convolutional neural network on a 27-class dataset to recognise dynamic hand
                    gestures, and introduced a mapping methodology for a novel Unity environment.<br><br>This project

                    A novel design of an emergency vehicle combining classical mechanics with electronics engineering. A
                    hydraulic master-slave cylinder system was built, actuated with a stepper/lead screw and a makeshift
                    connecting rod. The robot was fitted with multiple HC-SR04 distance sensors to calculate
                    velocity, acceleration and 'jerk' (rate of change of acceleration) such that a contact surface was
                    correctly projected to slow an object's momentum without restitution.<br><br>This project was
                    done as part of my 3rd-year undergraduate module 'Systems Engineering for Robotics'. It remains a
                    highlight of my studies.<br><br>I received an overall grade of 83% in this project.

                    This website was developed from scratch over a period of 9 days.<br><br> I used Jira as a project
                    management tool, and github as version control. It is written in pure HTML/CSS and JS, structured
                    with CSS Grids and Flexboxes, without Bootsrap, GSAP or any finishing libraries. It was designed in
                    2 days, broken into fundamental steps using Jira on the 3rd day, and code-writing took a further 6
                    days.<br><br>Future updates to this website will include these extraneous libraries in order to
                    bring it up to commercial quality. However, this first iteration is quite close to what I imagined
                    under such a short timeframe.
